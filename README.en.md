# L4D2 Bridge Nightly

> **This build includes DXVK (GPLALL), L4N and the Bridge tools in one package. Extract and copy to install; no separate component downloads are needed. Do not mix it with other similar projects or bundles.**
>
> **Remove the `-vulkan` launch option and back up/move away `d3d9.dll` from the game root; keep this package's `bin/d3d9.dll`.** L4N / Left4Neko is the work of **Starfelll (@Starfelll)**, with thanks to its original author.

## Download and installation — start here

**v1.2.2 fully integrates the IPC stability fixes from upstream 1.2.2.** One local comparison of the v1.2.1 candidate carrying the same production patch against v1.1.10 showed roughly **8% lower average FPS**, no material 1% low improvement, and official map transitions of about **10–11 seconds** in both builds. The maintainer chose to adopt the update after reviewing this tradeoff; this is not a claim of higher FPS or proven long-term stability. See the [measurements, test conditions and final rebuild limits](docs/UPSTREAM-1.2.2-INTEGRATION.md). IPC protocol is now **3**: update or roll back the Client and both Hosts together, never mix versions.

**[Download the full package from Releases](https://github.com/NPCodex/L4D2_Dxvk_32to64_Bridge-Nightlybuild/releases)**. Each release has one `l4d2-bridge-*.zip` and its `.sha256` checksum. It includes **L4N 2.51.0, DXVK-GPLALL, Bridge, `dxvk.conf`, L4N's `left4dead2/neko/config.vdf`**, and the repaired `bin/studiorender.dll`. No patch tool or Python installation is needed. The layout follows the maintainer's supplied bundle; `config_template.vdf` is omitted. See [bundle provenance](docs/L4N-BUNDLE.md). The player ZIP contains runtime components, active configuration, L4N's original VDF templates and QC/VMT examples, a short `README.txt`, and one combined `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt`. Developer documentation, JSON manifests, diagnostic scripts, the SDK and offline Mod authoring tools remain in the repository.

1. **Exit the game and Bridge Host, then back up existing files.** Save the original `left4dead2.exe`, L4N files, client, Host, `dxvk.conf`, `left4dead2/neko/config.vdf`, Bridge configuration and `bin/studiorender.dll`. Extract the ZIP into a temporary directory. If ThinFlex is already installed, keep the initial original-DLL backup. If another similar project is installed, uninstall it or restore its original files before installing this package.
2. **Preserve configuration before upgrading:** remove any configuration you want to retain (`dxvk.conf`, `left4dead2/neko/config.vdf`, `bin/.l4d2bridge/bridge.conf`) from the temporary extraction directory before copying. If you customized your backend, also remove the packaged `bin/.l4d2bridge/d3d9vk_x64.dll` and `d3d9vk_x86.dll` there. Skip this step on first installation. Back up personal changes to L4N shaders and other files with matching paths, as those will also be replaced.
3. **Check the installed engine DLL:** run `Get-FileHash 'your-game-directory\bin\studiorender.dll' -Algorithm SHA256` in PowerShell and compare with the table below. The supported original can be replaced. If the repair is already installed, retain it and the original backup. **For any other hash, remove `bin/studiorender.dll` from the temporary extraction directory and update Bridge only.**
4. **Copy the prepared files:** remove `-vulkan` and back up/move away any game-root `d3d9.dll`. Merge the prepared files into the game root beside `left4dead2.exe`, installing L4N, DXVK and the matching Client/Hosts together. Replacing the matching `studiorender.dll` applies ThinFlex directly. **Keep `bin/d3d9.dll`**, the Bridge client; the matching x86/x64 Hosts, backends and configuration stay in `bin/.l4d2bridge`. Follow this layout instead of the ordinary DXVK instructions in the original L4N readme.

| Installed `bin/studiorender.dll` | SHA-256 |
|---|---|
| Supported original | `3f5f5b0f539e8ad22bcfc4381be41571257c0c29e8061057682f9b8525ca7b85` |
| Packaged repair | `03964dedcf8b7f4ebde24cd3d0738873d37c075a7a9b313dad001bb937f9d1b6` |

The user has reported a successful ThinFlex retest, limited to this exact version. Recheck after game updates: copying files does not automatically check the installed version. The repository [engine manifest](runtime/engine/studiorender.manifest.json) records the changes; the packaged `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` preserves attribution. The modified DLL's original digital signature is invalid. See the [installation and restoration guide](docs/THINFLEX-TEST-README.txt).

To use `-vulkan`, rename the client to `dxvk_d3d9.dll` within the game `bin`. When switching to the default loading path, back up the old `bin/dxvk_d3d9.dll` and remove `-vulkan`. Both paths share `bin/.l4d2bridge`.

The full package includes both x64/x86 Hosts and matching GPLALL backends. **x64 remains the default.** To switch, set `client.testX86Server=False` for x64 or `True` for x86, retain `forceX64Server=True`, and restart the entire game.

L4N and the Bridge settings menu plugin are installed together. The plugin is already at `bin/neko/plugins/L4D2BridgePlugin.dll` and becomes available in the L4N menu when the game starts. Installing it does not change configuration or run GC; those actions require menu selections. To disable the menu, exit the game and move or delete that DLL; Bridge itself will still work. See the [L4N guide](docs/L4N-BRIDGE-CONTROLS.md). Original L4N documentation and author attribution are included in the combined `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt`; see also the [Starfelll notice](licenses/L4N-NOTICE.txt).

Fresh installs use upstream's learned-aggressive retention policy and disable routine memory/crash/data diagnostics by default. Preserve your installed configuration when upgrading. See [configuration settings and costs](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

Roll back the Bridge client and Host together. Restore your original `studiorender.dll` backup to undo ThinFlex. To uninstall, remove the installed files and restore your backups.

The [current IPC comparison](docs/UPSTREAM-1.2.2-INTEGRATION.md) records FPS and map transitions with this machine's GPLALL + x64 Host configuration. The [flashlight investigation](docs/FLASHLIGHT-PERFORMANCE-2026-10-10.md) and [earlier paired runs](docs/PERFORMANCE-2026-10-10.md) concern previous versions; see also the [game validation guide](docs/GAME-VALIDATION.md).

Based on [NVIDIA dxvk-remix Bridge](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/dxvk-remix), this repository retains the patches from the [original L4D2 project](https://github.com/yeyunyyds/L4D2_Dxvk_32to64_Bridge) and automatically builds an x86 client and both x86/x64 Hosts for 32-bit Left 4 Dead 2.

## Differences from upstream

- Builds only Bridge; the RTX Remix renderer is neither built nor distributed.
- Applies L4D2 patches for Host and backend loading paths, surface and buffer shadow-memory management, diagnostic logging, and game-specific configuration. See [patches/l4d2-bridge.patch](patches/l4d2-bridge.patch).
- Uses **DXVK-GPLALL 2.6.8-2 x64** as the default backend. Its version and download checksum are pinned separately in [config/backend.json](config/backend.json); updating Bridge does not automatically update the backend.
- Adds upstream monitoring, automated builds and tests, Nightly releases, and minimal runtime packaging.
- Fixes volume-texture byte pitches and upload offsets to prevent corrupted color-correction lookup tables. See [fix provenance and validation](docs/VOLUME-TEXTURE-COLOR-FIX.md).
- Fully integrates original-project **1.2.2 / `de74cd7`**, including the latest bidirectional IPC reservation, consumption, wrap and failure-propagation fixes, plus PageBlock retention/reclaim/recovery, manual GC, Reset state handling, Presenter/input paths, diagnostic separation, x86 Host and L4N settings. Source, presets, tests and the optional DXVK memory experiment are retained; the experimental backend does not replace default GPLALL. See [integration tracking](docs/ORIGINAL-PROJECT-UPDATES.md).
- Extends creation-failure cleanup to volume/cube textures, vertex/index buffers and standalone surfaces, releasing client wrappers and clearing outputs. Response timeouts retain ordered server cleanup.
- Hardens buffer-lock bounds and volume temporary ownership, and optimizes contiguous uploads and queue reads. See [validation methodology](docs/RUNTIME-RELIABILITY.md).

`bin/d3d9.dll` is the 32-bit Bridge client. `.l4d2bridge/d3d9vk_x64.dll` and `d3d9vk_x86.dll` serve the matching Host architectures.

## Automatic and manual builds

The workflow checks the NVIDIA build source default branch (currently `main`) every hour at minute 23. It builds unpublished commits and skips commits that already have a published release. GitHub scheduling may be delayed.

Under **Actions → Build latest upstream Bridge → Run workflow**:

- Leave `upstream_commit` empty to follow the latest source, or enter a full 40-character SHA to select a commit.
- Enable `force_rebuild` to create a new independent build without replacing existing assets. This option is disabled by default.
- Enable `validation_only` to build, test and run A/B benchmarks, saving artifacts and skipping publication.
- Enable `thinflex_test` to label a full upstream integration + ThinFlex test release (Pre-release, not Latest). Every build includes the fixed ThinFlex engine DLL in one full package; check the installed game version before copying it.

Deduplication checks both upstream SHA and a fingerprint of build/package/test inputs. Versions use `nightly-YYYYMMDD-upstreamSHA-rRecipeDigest-bRunID.Attempt`. Dates use upstream commit UTC time. Rebuilds and reruns have separate versions, preserving old assets. Release notes record full identities. JSON manifests remain build-validation inputs and are excluded from the player ZIP. Patch, compile or test failures prevent publication.

When reusing a local source checkout, the build script verifies the complete patch and index, rejecting additional source changes while preserving the checkout. Rerunning a failed publish job searches paginated release listings for the unpublished draft, verifies existing assets and uploads only missing files. Conflicting assets stop publication; existing files are never overwritten.
